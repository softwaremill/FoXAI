                - a single integer or a tensor containing a single

                - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                    the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                    is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                    elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                    #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the

                tuple containing multiple additional arguments including
                tensors or any arbitrary python types. These arguments
                are provided to forward_func in order following the
                arguments in inputs.
                Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                to these arguments.
                Default: None

                to layer outputs.
                Note that currently it is assumed that either the input
                or the output of internal layer, depending on whether we
                attribute to the input or output, is a single tensor.

        Returns:
