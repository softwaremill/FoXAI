        Under the hood this method is calling `DeepLiftShap.attribute` function and

        https://github.com/pytorch/captum/blob/master/captum/attr/_core/deep_lift.py.

        Args:
            model: The forward function of the model or any
                modification of it.
            input_data: Input for which
                attributions are computed. If forward_func takes a single
                tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
            pred_label_idx: Output indices for
                which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                this is usually the target class).
                If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                no target index is necessary.
                For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                    integer, which is applied to all input examples

                - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                    the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                    is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                    elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                    examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                    #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                    target for the corresponding example.

                Default: None
            baselines:
                Baselines define reference samples that are compared with
                the inputs. In order to assign attribution scores DeepLift
                computes the differences between the inputs/outputs and
                corresponding references.
                Baselines can be provided as:

                - a single tensor, if inputs is a single tensor, with
                    exactly the same dimensions as inputs or the first
                    dimension is one and the remaining dimensions match
                    with inputs.

                - a single scalar, if inputs is a single tensor, which will
                    be broadcasted for each input value in input tensor.

                In the cases when `baselines` is not provided, we internally
                use zero scalar corresponding to each input tensor.
                Default: None
            additional_forward_args: If the forward function
                requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a tuple
                containing multiple additional arguments including tensors
                or any arbitrary python types. These arguments are provided to
                forward_func in order, following the arguments in inputs.
                Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                to these arguments.
                Default: None
            custom_attribution_func: A custom function for
                computing final attribution scores. This function can take
                at least one and at most three arguments with the
                following signature:

                - custom_attribution_func(multipliers)

                - custom_attribution_func(multipliers, inputs)

                - custom_attribution_func(multipliers, inputs, baselines)

                In case this function is not provided, we use the default
                logic defined as: multipliers * (inputs - baselines)
                It is assumed that all input arguments, `multipliers`,
                `inputs` and `baselines` are provided in tuples of same
                length. `custom_attribution_func` returns a tuple of
                attribution tensors that have the same length as the
                `inputs`.
                Default: None
            attribute_to_layer_input: Argument present only for `LayerDeepLiftShap`.
                Indicates whether to compute the attributions with respect
                to the layer input or output. If `attribute_to_layer_input`
                is set to True then the attributions will be computed with
                respect to layer inputs, otherwise it will be computed with
                respect to layer outputs.
                Note that currently it assumes that both the inputs and
                outputs of internal layers are single tensors.
                Support for multiple tensors will be added later.
                Default: False

        Returns:
            Attribution score computed based on DeepLift rescale rule with respect
            to each input feature. Attributions will always be
            the same size as the provided inputs, with each value
            providing the attribution of the corresponding input index.
            If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
            returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
            corresponding sized tensors is returned.

        Raises:
