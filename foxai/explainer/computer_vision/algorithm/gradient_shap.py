        Args:
            model: The forward function of the model or any

            input_data: Input for which SHAP attribution
                values are computed. If `forward_func` takes a single
                tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
            pred_label_idx: Output indices for
                which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                this is usually the target class).
                If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                no target index is necessary.
                For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                    integer, which is applied to all input examples

                - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                    the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                    is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                    elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                    examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                    #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                    target for the corresponding example.

                Default: None
            baselines:
                Baselines define the starting point from which expectation
                is computed and can be provided as:

                - a single tensor, if inputs is a single tensor, with
                    exactly the same dimensions as inputs or the first
                    dimension is one and the remaining dimensions match
                    with inputs.
                - a batch tensor, if inputs is a batch tensor, with
                    each tensor of a batch with exactly the same dimensions as
                    inputs and the first dimension is number of different baselines
                    to compute and aggregate score. Typical usage of batch
                    baselines is to provide random baselines and compute mean
                    attributes from them.

                It is recommended that the number of samples in the baselines'
                tensors is larger than one.
            n_samples: The number of randomly generated examples
                per sample in the input batch. Random examples are
                generated by adding gaussian random noise to each sample.
                Default: `5` if `n_samples` is not provided.
            stdevs: The standard deviation
                of gaussian noise with zero mean that is added to each
                input in the batch. If `stdevs` is a single float value
                then that same value is used for all inputs. If it is
                a tuple, then it must have the same length as the inputs
                tuple. In this case, each stdev value in the stdevs tuple
                corresponds to the input with the same index in the inputs
                tuple.
                Default: 0.0
            additional_forward_args: If the forward function
                requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                can be provided. It can contain a tuple of ND tensors or
                any arbitrary python type of any shape.
                In case of the ND tensor the first dimension of the
                tensor must correspond to the batch size. It will be
                repeated for each `n_steps` for each randomly generated
                input sample.

                Note that the gradients are not computed with respect
                to these arguments.
                Default: None
            attribute_to_layer_input (bool, optional): Indicates whether to
                compute the attribution with respect to the layer input
                or output. If `attribute_to_layer_input` is set to True
                then the attributions will be computed with respect to
                layer input, otherwise it will be computed with respect
                to layer output.

                Note that currently it is assumed that either the input
                or the output of internal layer, depending on whether we
                attribute to the input or output, is a single tensor.
                Support for multiple tensors will be added later.
                Default: False
            layer: Layer for which attributions are computed.
                If None provided, last convolutional layer from the model
                is taken.
                Default: None

        Returns:
            Attribution score computed based on GradientSHAP with respect
            to each input feature. Attributions will always be
            the same size as the provided inputs, with each value
            providing the attribution of the corresponding input index.
            If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
            returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
            corresponding sized tensors is returned.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: if attribution has shape (0).
